## CubeStrike
### Win32GLNetTemplate

- This project is an example of the minimum amount of code needed to compile a 3D application on 32-bit Windows that supports networking.
The intention was to create the simplest P2P network game. Unfortunately, due to NAT translation and other obstacles, it's probably necessary
to create a client/server application and still overcome usual obstacles like port-forwarding. Hopefully, the game "Cube-Strike" will finally
be created.
